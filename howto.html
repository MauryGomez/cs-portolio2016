    <h2>How its made: Navbar</h2>
    When first starting this website, I learned how to put together the navbar that is at the top of each page. First I needed to enter the tag ul to make an unordered list. After, I needed to add in the links under the ul tag to redirect the user to different parts of my page. Using the link tag and the href, I entered the links to redirect the users to the other pages on my site, after the ending carrot for the href tag I added the word that will display to the user for them to interact with. This can be seen in my code below. When mousing over the code below, will show the navbar as the code is telling it to,without css. 
     <!--<img src="image/navbar.png"; style="width400px;height:200px;"-->
      <div onmouseover="navBarst()" onmouseout="navBarfn()">
      <img id="navBarfst" src="image/navbar.png" />
      
       
    </div>

    <h2>Decorating the Navbar</h2>
    To decorate or add aesthetics to the navbar you will either need to make a style tag or what I did, is using css in an external page to style the navbar. Fisrt, I used the text-align:center; to center the navbar options. Then I used background-color:black; to color the back ground of the navbar black. After that I started a new section relating to the links in the navbar, using the display css property to show the navbar link in a certain way, in this case, I wanted the links to be solid blocks(so you would use display:solid block;), and in a horizontal line (using display:inline-block;). For the border and padding property, I used it to change the size of my border and padding around each text in my navbar.
   
   <!-- <div><img src="image/navbardec.png" ; style="width400px;height:200px;"</div> -->
  
  <div  onmouseover="navBarDesc()" onmouseout="navBarPic()">
      <img id="navBarinfo" src="image/navbarpic.png" />
  </div>

    <h2>How its made: Hardware Page</h2>
        From my hardware page I need to desrcibe all the components needed to make computer. Which is the motherboard, CPU, RAM, PSU, HDD, the BUS system and whatever Peripherals you need. The same process is used to make every section of the hardware page, changing the picture and the desrciption. To make the title of the hardware page I used the tag &lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt; and between the opening and closing tags, I wrote Computer Hardware to create the first header or title. Then I used the tag &lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;to create my subheader of "Motherboard" to make a smaller title. Under the &lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; you can start typing for the description of, in this case, the Motherboard. Then to add the picture I found the picture I want and saved it on my computer and the inserted it to my images file then used &lt;img src=&quot;image/motherboard.png&quot; img tag is use to tell the file is a picture and src=image/ is tell the computer the picture is in the image file the then insert the name of the picture file. Then to resize the picture I used the style tag to set the width and the height of the picture; style=&quot;width:304px;height:228px;&quot;. Finally, to section off the part I wrote, I used the &lt;hr&gt; tag to make a line under everthing above the tag.

               document.getElementById("navBarinfo").src = 'image/navbardec.png';
           }
    
            function navBarPic(){
                
                document.getElementById("navBarinfo").src =  'image/navbarpic.png';
            }     
            
       function navBarst(){
               document.getElementById("navBarfst").src = 'image/navbarnocss.png';
           }
    
            function navBarfn(){
                document.getElementById("navBarfst").src =  'image/navbar.png';
            }

       <h2>How its made: Calculator</h2>
       
       To start making the Calculator you are going to need to start three new files called calc.html, calc.css and calc.js. First on the html file you are going to to want to create an input box using the input tag of &lt;input&gt; but you will need to give the box a id to differentiate each input box, I give the box the idea of num1 because its were my first number will go for the calculation. After the first input box is made yo are going to need to make a selector drop down menu to choose the different operations. To do this you will need to use the &lt;select&gt;&lt;/select&gt; tag and give it an id to later make it variable in javascript. To add each operation in the drop down menu, under the select tag use the &lt;option&gt; inside the caret after the option give the tag a value of the operation you are going to assign to it.For example if you want to an option of addition/+ you would use &lt;option value="+"&gt;+&lt;/option&gt; and display the symbol of the operation in the drop down menu you write what you want between the opening tag and the closing tag, in this case a + symbol. I made an option for each of the 6 opertion I used. After that make another input box after the drop down menu code, same as the first one but with id of num3 because this is were the second number will go in for the calculator. Then I added a button so when its clicked it displays the answer, to do this I used the button tag of, &lt;button (here is were you give the button the id of solve)&gt;(here is were you place the name of what you want to display on the user's screen) &lt;/button&gt;. In order to display the answer of the calclator is going have you are going to need a div tag with the id of display, &lt;div id = display&gt;&lt;/div&gt;. After you have done these steps you are going to need to use javascript make the calculator function, so you wil need to link the javascript in the html with &lt;script src=&quot;calc.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;. 
  <br>

  <br>
  Once you are done coding the html side of the calculator, you are going to use javascript to make the code talk within itself to give you your answer. To start you are going have to make a variable for every id having to do with the calculator. You do this by using var then give your variable a name. After that you will link that variable with the id using document.getElementById(placing the id here), repeat until every id is connected to a variable(ex:var num1input = document.getElementById(&quot;num1&quot;)). Then you will need to add an event listener to listen for a click on the solve button using solve.addEventListener("click", function(){})., with solve being the variable. Then after the event listener you will need to add two more variable connecting the input boxes so the javascript can read what is in the two input boxes, var num1 = num1input.value; var num2 = num2input.value;. Finally, all you need to do it the if else statement to tell javascript if a certain symbol is in the select box of drop down menu to do that operation and if the symbol isnt there to read the next if else statement. To add two numbers you will use, if the selector value = "+", var answer = +num1 + +num2, and then use display.innerhtml= answer to display the answer on screen. The final javascript code should look like the picture below.
