    <h1>Vindinium</h1>

    <img src="image/vindinium.png" ;>

    <p>Vindinium is a turn based game, in which the goal is to have the most amount of gold in the set amount of rounds. Everyround you gain gold accord to the number of mines you own, if an enemy bot were to you they gain control of all the mines you owned.
        When you attack a mine to take control of it you lose health, you also lose health everytime the bot moves. To gain health back the bot will need to go to a tavern. The bots are only controlled by the code that makes them up, whether it be to
        only attack enemies, mine or both. The Vindinium map is randoomly cycled every round, from big to small maps with different amounts of mine and taverns depending on the size of the map. </p>

    <h2>Deciding What to Do</h2>
    <pre>
            <code>
                   var task = "none";
        //determines if my bot gold is lower than enemy bots gold, if so to attack mines
        if (bot.yourBot.gold < enemyBots[0].gold && bot.yourBot.gold < enemyBots[1].gold && bot.yourBot.gold < enemyBots[2].gold) {
            task = "allMines";
        }
        //determines if bot life is low to get move health if collect free mines
        else if (bot.yourBot.life < 60) {
            task = "lowhealth";
        }
        //determines if health is higher than enemy bot, to attack bot if its two spaces aways
        else if (bot.findDistance(myPos, closestBot.posArray) < 4 && bot.yourBot.life > enemyBots[0]) {
            task = "killBot";
        }
        else {
            task = "allMines";
        }
            </code>
        </pre>
<p>The comments above a block of code with describe a general idea on what the code does. Here I will have a detail explanation of what the code block do. In the fist code block I have an if statement with the condition, that if the condition is true it will run the task, that if my gold is lower that all of the other enemy bots it will then run the task I have assigned to it which is "allMines" but if my gold is not lower than the enemy bots then the code will run the next line of code, my if else statement. The if else statement check to see if the if statement is false to check if its condinition are meet, in this case the condinition is bot.yourBot.life < 60, which mean if my bots health is lower than 60 it will run the block of code if the condinition is true, which is task lowhealth. Then I put another if else statement with the condiition of, if my bot is 2 or less blocks away from an enemy bot and my health is higher than that bot then run the block of code which is a task to move towards the enenmy to attack it. Lastly, I have an else statement that runs is the other 3 statements are false which I assigned my bot to attack mines.</p>
    <h2>Determining How to Do It </h2>
    <pre>
            <code>
                 // this will determine which mine is the closest
        if (task === "allMines") {
            var closestMine = allMines[0];
            for (var i = 0; i < allMines.length; i++) {
                if (bot.findDistance(myPos, closestMine) > bot.findDistance(myPos, allMines[i])) {
                    closestMine = allMines[i];
                }
            }
            console.log("Yay! Collecting Free Mine!");
            myDir = bot.findPath(myPos, closestMine);
        }
        // this will determine which tavern is the closest and move to it 
        if (task === "lowhealth") {
            var closesttavern = bot.taverns[0];
            for (var i = 0; i < bot.taverns.length; i++) {
                if (bot.findDistance(myPos, closesttavern) > bot.findDistance(myPos, bot.taverns[i])) {
                    closesttavern = bot.taverns[i];
                }
            }
            console.log("Low Health, Going to Tavern!");
            myDir = bot.findPath(myPos, closesttavern);
        }
        //determines what bot is the closest and moves to it
        if (task === "killBot") {

            console.log("Attacking Enemy!");
            myDir = bot.findPath(myPos, closestBot.posArray);
        }




        if (task === "none") {
            console.log("Going Random!");
            var rand = Math.floor(Math.random() * 4);
            var dirs = ["north", "south", "east", "west"];
            myDir = dirs[rand];
        }
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p> When my if, if else and else statements are true in my what to do then they will run tasks in my how to do(shown above). If the task allMines is ran my bot will look for the closest mine that is near is current position and move towards that mine and capture it and will log in the console "Yay! Collecting Free Mine!". If the task lowhealth is ran then my bot will check its position, look for the closest tavern and travel to that tavern and display in the console "Low Health, Going to Tavern!" If the task killBot is ran then it will log in the console "Attacking Enemy!" If task = none then the bot will pick a number 1-3 which depending on the number will tell it to go in a direction and log that direction in the console.  </p>
    <h2>What I Learned about AI</h2>
    During the third round of expeditions, I learn more about coding and focused mainly on coding AI bots to compete againists other bots made by the other students in the class. The hardest part about coding the AI bots was tell the bot everything you want
    it to do in the arena and being detail. If something is left out or not as details it will either not work or not work like you wanted it to. Once everthing was wotrking at the end, I put my bot in the arena to test how it would put up with the other
    bot. For the most part my bot would do what
