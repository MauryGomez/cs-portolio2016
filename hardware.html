<h2>Motherboard</h2>
<p> The motherboard is the main curcit board when making a computer it holds or connects to all of the other components of the computer.The motherboard is how everything connect together in the computer can communicate to eachother so everything is working correctly. The motherboard is held in the case of the computer usally by srew in mount.</p>

<h2> Central Processing Unit(CPU)</h2>
    <p> The CPU or Central Processing Unit is what most people call the brain of the computer. The CPU processes all information, programs and data that a computer recieves. There are also processor the say they are multicore which mean each core is another processor.  </p>

Once the computer is turned off everything on the RAM stick is deleted. This can also be known as or called a Volatile curcuits becuase the memory is based on the power the chip receives, no power means no memory.</p>
